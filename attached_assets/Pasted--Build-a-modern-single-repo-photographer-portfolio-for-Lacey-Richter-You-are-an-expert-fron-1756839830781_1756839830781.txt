# Build a modern, single‑repo photographer portfolio for **Lacey Richter**

You are an expert front‑end developer and designer. Generate a production‑ready website using **static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (no frameworks). Keep the code clean, modular, and accessible. Optimize images and ship a cohesive, elegant aesthetic inspired by the reference sites listed below.

## References for style (inspiration only)

* [https://www.studiokfilm.com/](https://www.studiokfilm.com/)

**Direction to follow from these references:**

* Full‑bleed hero imagery with tasteful, thin typography and ample white space.
* Subtle motion on scroll (fade/slide, parallax on hero only, low intensity) using vanilla JavaScript + CSS transitions.
* Editorial layout for portfolio grid (masonry with varied item sizes), edge‑to‑edge.
* Minimal color palette, monochrome with a warm accent.
* Delicate separators, soft shadows, rounded‑2xl cards, generous padding.

## Assets (these image file names already exist in the repo)

> Place these in `/images/` and reference appropriately. Use exactly these filenames.

* `WEBSITE_COVER_PHOTO.jpg`  → Home hero background
* `Lacey.jpg`                → About page portrait
* `Couple_cover_pic.jpg`     → Use in Couples section card and as section header image
* `Brand.jpg`                → Brands/Commercial card
* `Maternity.jpg`            → Families & Maternity card and section header image
* `Portrait.jpg`             → Portraits card and section header image
* **Portfolio gallery set:** multiple files named like `portfolio.jpg`, `portfolio (2).jpg`, `portfolio (3).jpg`, ...  → Use across the Portfolio masonry grid.

**Do not rename these files.** Ensure responsive `object-fit: cover`, intrinsic sizing, and lazy loading.

## Information Architecture & Pages

Each page is its own static `.html` file. Use consistent header, footer, and styling via shared `style.css` and `script.js`.

* `index.html` (Home)
* `portfolio.html`
* `about.html`
* `investment.html`
* `contact.html`

Global header with logo (wordmark) left and nav right. Sticky on scroll with subtle translucent background blur. Global footer with social links and mini‑bio line.

---

## Page Specifications & Copy

(Keep same text content as already detailed: Home hero, feature strips, testimonials, portfolio masonry grid, About copy, Investment pricing cards, Contact form, etc.)

---

## Global Components & UX

* **Header**: wordmark “By Lacey Richter”; nav links; hover underline animation; mobile menu (slide‑down with JS toggle).
* **Footer**: mini‑bio line; © year; links to **Instagram** and **Pinterest**.
* **Buttons**: slim, pill‑ish, subtle accent border.
* **Lightbox**: implemented with vanilla JS; keyboard navigation and escape to close.
* **Testimonials carousel**: auto‑advance with pause on hover; vanilla JS.

---

## Technical Requirements

* **Stack**: static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only.
* **File structure:**

```
index.html
portfolio.html
about.html
investment.html
contact.html
/css/style.css
/js/script.js
/images/* (all assets)
```

* **Images**: lazy load non‑critical; set width/height; CSS `aspect-ratio` for consistency.
* **SEO**: set `<title>` and meta description per page; Open Graph tags; JSON‑LD `Person` schema.
* **Performance**: compress images; minify CSS/JS.
* **Accessibility**: semantic landmarks; form labels tied to inputs; aria attributes.

---

## Form Handling

* Contact form uses basic JS validation for required fields.
* On submit: prevent default, show a success message inline (mock only).
* Leave clear `// TODO:` comment where backend integration can be added.

---

## Deliverables

1. Fully working static site with HTML, CSS, and JS.
2. Pixel‑perfect pages and responsive layout.
3. SEO tags and Open Graph image using `WEBSITE_COVER_PHOTO.jpg`.
4. Accessibility pass.
5. Instructions in `README.md` for adding portfolio images and deploying.

## Nice‑to‑Have (if time allows)

* Simple color‑grade overlay on portfolio hover.
* Smooth scroll to `#kind-words` from Home.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

* All specified images are used in their intended sections.
* Hero looks refined with elegant type; CTAs function.
* Portfolio grid loads and opens images in lightbox.
* Contact form validates and shows success message.
* Pricing cards match copy and allow linking from Investment to Contact.
* Mobile layout is excellent (header, cards, grids, lightbox).
